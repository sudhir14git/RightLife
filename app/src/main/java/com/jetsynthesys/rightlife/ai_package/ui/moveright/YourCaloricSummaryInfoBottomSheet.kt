        <h2>What is Your Caloric Balance?</h2>
        <p><b>Your body is constantly using energy</b>â€”whether you're working out, walking, or even resting. Your <b>Caloric Summary</b> breaks this process down into three key numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Calories In</b> â†’ The energy from the food and drinks you consume.</li>
  <li><b>Calories Out</b> â†’ The energy your body burns throughout the day.</li>
  <li><b>Caloric Balance</b> â†’ The difference between the two, which tells you if you're in a deficit (burning more) or surplus (consuming more).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calories In: What You Eat and Drink</h3>
<p>Everything you eat and drink contains calories, which provide the energy your body needs to function.</p>
<p><b>Where do Calories In come from?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Meals & Snacks</b> â†’ Every bite of food contributes to your calorie intake.</li>
  <li><b>Drinks</b> â†’ Some drinks (like sodas, juices, and alcohol) have calories, while others (like water, black coffee, and tea) donâ€™t.</li>
  <li><b>Supplements & Shakes</b> â†’ Protein shakes, meal replacements, and supplements also add to your intake.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping an accurate log of what you consume helps ensure your Calories In count reflects your actual intake. While calorie tracking is important, itâ€™s not just about how many calories you consume, but <b>where those calories come from</b>.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s where logging your food on <b>RightLife</b> comes in handy. We use gold-standard nutritional databases, AI-powered meal logging, and precision metabolic tracking to ensure your calorie intake and nutritional source align with your weight goal.</p>

<h3>Calories OUT: The Energy You Burn</h3>
<p>Your body constantly burns caloriesâ€”even when you're not moving! The <b>Calories Out</b> number includes three main types of calorie burn:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</b> â†’ The calories your body burns just to stay alive (breathing, digesting, thinking, maintaining body temperature, etc.). This makes up about 60-70% of your total daily energy burn.</li>
  <li><b>Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)</b> â†’ The energy required to digest, absorb, and process the food you eat. Generally, this accounts for about 10% of your total calories burned daily (higher for protein-rich foods, lower for fats).</li>
  <li><b>Active Burn (Activity Calories)</b> â†’ This includes everything you do beyond basic survival:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Workouts</b> â†’ Running, weightlifting, cycling, yoga, etc.</li>
      <li><b>Daily Movement</b> â†’ Walking, climbing stairs, carrying groceries.</li>
      <li><b>Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT)</b> â†’ Fidgeting, standing, cleaning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What Do the Numbers Mean?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Deficit</b> â†’ You're burning more than you're consuming. This is ideal for weight loss.</li>
  <li><b>Surplus</b> â†’ You're consuming more than you're burning. Useful for muscle gain or maintaining high energy levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Use the Caloric Summary in RightLife</h3>
<p>RightLife simplifies calorie tracking by doing the heavy lifting for you. Unlike other apps that rely on static numbers, we dynamically adjust your caloric needs based on real-time data. We use a custom metabolic model based on the <b>Cunningham 1991 equation</b>, also known as the <b>Katch-McArdle equation</b>.</p>

<h3>What RightLife Does for You</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Adapts to Changes in Your BMR</b> â†’ Your BMR isnâ€™t fixed. As you gain or lose weight, RightLife recalculates your BMR to reflect your bodyâ€™s evolving energy needs.</li>
  <li><b>Updates Your Activity Factor</b> â†’ We continuously adjust your daily calorie burn based on logged activity and overall movementâ€”ensuring an accurate picture of energy expenditure.</li>
  <li><b>Tracks Your Calories In & Out</b> â†’ RightLife logs your food intake and estimates your calorie burn, including resting metabolism, digestion, and activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What You Need to Do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ”¹ <b>Log Your Meals</b> â†’ Enter your food intake to keep track of Calories In. RightLife does the math for you.</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¹ <b>Record Your Activity or Sync Your Wearable</b> â†’ Workouts, steps, and movement all count. RightLife updates Calories Out to reflect your energy burn.</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¹ <b>Check Your Balance</b> â†’ Know if youâ€™re in a deficit, surplus, or maintenance. Weâ€™ll make the adjustments for you.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>By regularly checking your Caloric Summary</b>, you can make better decisions about your nutrition, workouts, and daily habitsâ€”helping you achieve your fitness and health goals more effectively! ðŸš€</p>
